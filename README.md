honestly, I don't really know what I should write here, but all I can say is that this is my first project I’ve ever published on GitHub.
I’m creating useful Python codes with AI, and I decided to publish this one because I saw an app on Steam named "Borderless Gaming", which costs around 6–7 euros in Europe. 
Then I thought, why not make it myself and share it with people? I figured it shouldn’t be that hard, and it’s not really worth spending that much money on such a basic app.

I don’t know much about coding, but if there are any bugs or issues, I’m willing to spend my time fixing them. (yeah with AI)
Thank you for trying out my project!
